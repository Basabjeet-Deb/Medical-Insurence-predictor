# Medical-Insurence-predictor
🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
A machine learning-based web app that predicts medical insurance costs based on user inputs such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. Built using Python, Scikit-Learn, and Jupyter Notebook, this project applies multi-linear regression with feature engineering for improved accuracy.

🚀 Features
✅ User-friendly interface for input selection
✅ Real-time predictions of medical charges 💰
✅ Feature engineering for better model accuracy 🎯
✅ Performance metrics (R² Score, MSE, MAE) 📊
✅ Confidence interval for predictions 📏

📌 Dataset & Features
The model is trained on a medical insurance dataset with:

age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region
Engineered Features: age^2, bmi^2, bmi*smoker, age*smoker
⚙ How It Works
1️⃣ Enter age, BMI, smoker status, region, etc.
2️⃣ Click "Predict Charges" to get the estimated cost
3️⃣ View detailed performance metrics for the model
